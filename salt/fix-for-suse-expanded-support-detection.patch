Subject: [PATCH] Fix for SUSE Expanded Support detection

A SUSE ES installation has both, the centos-release and redhat-release
file. Since os_data only used the centos-release file to detect a
CentOS installation, this lead to SUSE ES being detected as CentOS.

This change also adds a check for redhat-release and then marks the
'lsb_distrib_id' as RedHat.
